# GymLog
A simple Android application to create and manage workout plans and history. 

### Description
The goal of the project is to create a simple yet very customizable workout tracker. It is being written in Java, but the language may change in the future.

### Features
The main features are:
* creating custom workout plans
* adding a certain number of sets, reps, weight, time (or even a custom note instead) to every exercise
* analyzing progress by exercises or a workout plan
* a possibility to add notes during a training which will be saved in the training history
* two different modes (simple notebook-like and measuring time and pace)
